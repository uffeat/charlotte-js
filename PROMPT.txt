Please give me a JS version of the Python script below. 
Please keep the snake case for method names.
Please add the JSDoc style comments.
Please also let me know if the code makes sense or if you detect any mistakes.



In the code JS code snippet below, I do not quite understand the kwargs parameter. 
Does the function expect a series of arg or an object?


function attach_shadow(kwargs) {
  kwargs = { ...kwargs };
  const { delegates_focus = false, html = null, sheets = null } = kwargs;
  // The rest of the function here...
