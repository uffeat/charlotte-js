Please give me a JS version of the Python script below. 
Please keep the snake case for method names.
Please add the JSDoc style comments.
Please also let me know if the code makes sense or if you detect any mistakes.


Please give me a JS function `parseHash` that parses `window.location.hash`.
I wish to use the function in connection with a client-side router. 
The function should return an object with the parsed result. 
Specifically, the function should return an object with (potentially) the following keys:
- `key`: A string corresponding to the part of `window.location.hash` between `#` and the first '/'.
- `params`: An array of subsequent strings between '/' characters
   provided that the string does not contain `?`. If there are none, `params` should be 
   not be added to the returned object.
- `query`: If `window.location.hash` ends with a part that starts with `?` or `/?`, 
   this part should be returned as an object parsed from the query string.

For example, 
parsing `#product/123/abc?name=stuff&number=42` or `#product/123/abc/?name=stuff&number=42` should give 
`{key: 'product', params: ['123', 'abc'], query: {name: 'stuff', number: '42'}}`;
parsing `#blog/first` or `#blog/first/` should give `{key: 'blog', params: ['first']}`,
and parsing `#home` or `#home/` should give `{key: 'home'}`
and parsing `#` should not return anything.

Please ensure that the function can handle encoding to that the returned result is decoded.
Please add explanatory comments.
